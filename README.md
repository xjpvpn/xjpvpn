## Roadmap

| Feature       | Status | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Init Protocol | DONE   | The protocol uses websocket between a SOCKS5 client and proxy server.                          |
| CI System     | TODO   | The CI should validate everything functions as intended. Security is a priority consideration. |
| Cipher System | TODO   | HTTPS is not enabled. A possible solution is to place NGINX in front of the proxy server.      |
